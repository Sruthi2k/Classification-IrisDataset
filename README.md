# Classification-IrisDataset
Classification of iris flowers:
Attributes are numeric
It is a multi-class classification problem (multi-nominal) that may require some specialized handling.
It only has 4 attributes and 150 rows, meaning it is small and easily fits into memory
This project mainly deals with:
1.Loading the dataset.
2.Summarizing the dataset.
3.Visualizing the dataset.
4.Evaluating some algorithms.
5.Making some predictions.
